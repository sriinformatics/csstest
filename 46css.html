CSS Conic Gradients

A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.

To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.
Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);

By default, angle is 0deg and position is center.

If no degree is specified, the colors will be spread equally around the center point.
Conic Gradient: Three Colors

The following example shows a conic gradient with three colors:
Example

A conic gradient with three colors:
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
Conic Gradient: Five Colors

The following example shows a conic gradient with five colors:
Example

A conic gradient with five colors:
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
}
Conic Gradient: Three Colors and Degrees

The following example shows a conic gradient with three colors and a degree for each color:
Example

A conic gradient with three colors and a degree for each color:
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(red 45deg, yellow 90deg, green 210deg);
}

Create Pie Charts

Just add border-radius: 50% to make the conic gradient look like a pie:
Example
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
  border-radius: 50%;
}

Here is another pie chart with defined degrees for all the colors:
Example
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(red 0deg, red 90deg, yellow 90deg, yellow 180deg, green 180deg, green 270deg, blue 270deg);
  border-radius: 50%;
}
Conic Gradient With Specified From Angle

The [from angle] specifies an angle that the entire conic gradient is rotated by.

The following example shows a conic gradient with a from angle of 90deg:
Example

A conic gradient with a from angle:
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(from 90deg, red, yellow, green);
}
Conic Gradient With Specified Center Position

The [at position] specifies the center of the conic gradient.

The following example shows a conic gradient with a center position of 60% 45%:
Example

A conic gradient with a specified center position:
#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(at 60% 45%, red, yellow, green);
}
Repeating a Conic Gradient

The repeating-conic-gradient() function is used to repeat conic gradients:
Example

A repeating conic gradient:
#grad {
  background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);
  border-radius: 50%;
}

Here is a repeating conic gradient with defined color-starts and color-stops:
Example

A repeating conic gradient with defined color-starts and color-stops:
#grad {
  background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 0deg 10deg, yellow 10deg 20deg, blue 20deg 30deg);
  border-radius: 50%;
