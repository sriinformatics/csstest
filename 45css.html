CSS Radial Gradients
CSS Radial Gradients

A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.
Syntax
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);

By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.

Radial Gradient - Evenly Spaced Color Stops (this is default)

The following example shows a radial gradient with evenly spaced color stops:
Example
#grad {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}

Radial Gradient - Differently Spaced Color Stops

The following example shows a radial gradient with differently spaced color stops:
Example
#grad {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red 5%, yellow 15%, green 60%);
}
Set Shape

The shape parameter defines the shape. It can take the value circle or ellipse. The default value is ellipse.

The following example shows a radial gradient with the shape of a circle:
Example
#grad {
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);
}

Use of Different Size Keywords

The size parameter defines the size of the gradient. It can take four values:

    closest-side
    farthest-side
    closest-corner
    farthest-corner

Example

A radial gradient with different size keywords:
#grad1 {
  background-image: radial-gradient(closest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
}

#grad2 {
  background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
}
Repeating a radial-gradient

The repeating-radial-gradient() function is used to repeat radial gradients:
Example

A repeating radial gradient:
#grad {
  background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 15%);
}
